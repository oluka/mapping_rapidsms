class App(rapidsms.App):
    """This app provides a generic way for Reporters and PersistantConnections
       to "follow" events triggered by other models. The linking is performed
       by dynamically-generated models; This maintains foreign key consistancy
       and integrates with the Django admin nicely.

       To make a Model followable, just add a "followable=True" attribute. The
       follow.models module will notice, and create an intermediate model to
       link your model with Reporter and/or PersistantConnection.
       For example:

           class MyFollowableModel(models.Model):
               something = models.CharField(max_length=20)
               followable = True

       Later that day, in the shell...

           >>> x = MyFollowableModel(something="Alpha")
           >>> adam = Reporter.objects.get(alias="adammck")
           >>> x.followers.add(reporter=adam)

       That's magic! It's not very Python-ish, since it's not explicit and all
       that, but allows models to easily become "followable" without requiring
       this app to be present. If it's not running, nothing explodes.

       For a model to be followable over SMS, it also needs to be searchable.
       Luckily, this is also easy. See the rapidsms.search module for docs, or
       reporters.models.Reporter.__search__ for an example. Once your model is
       searchable, it can be followed by anyone over SMS with some fairly simple
       syntax:

           ~~> I AM adammck
           <~~ Hello, Adam Mckaig!

           ~~> FOLLOW ewheeler
           <~~ You are now following Evan Wheeler.

           ~~> FOLLOW @3 czue nyc
           <~~ You are now following Mark Johnston, Cory Zue, and New York City.

       Back in the shell...

           >>> adam = Reporter.objects.get(alias="adammck")

           >>> adam.following_reporter_set.all()
           [<Reporter #2: Evan Wheeler (ewheeler)>,
            <Reporter #3: Mark Johnston (mej)>,
            <Reporter #4: Cory Zue (czue)>]

           >>> adam.following_location_set.all()
           [<Location #1: New York City>]"""
